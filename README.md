# Visual Studio Code Dark Plus theme for JetBrains IDEs

<!-- Plugin description -->
A dark theme for JetBrains IDEs inspired by default Visual Studio Code "Dark Plus" theme [PRE 2024 FORK].
<!-- Plugin description end -->

This is a fork of https://github.com/samdark/intellij-visual-studio-code-dark-plus aiming to preserve the old c# color theme before
https://github.com/samdark/intellij-visual-studio-code-dark-plus/commit/c97581ae94d9ca4a13bd2d97e34215d971614f5a

The other changes from upstream will be periodically pulled.

All credits go to the theme author https://github.com/samdark

Why fork?
JetBrains IDEs update plugins sometimes without the explicit gesture from the user and manually downgrading to the previous version is tiresome. Plus the other changes upstream offers are good.
